## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 1 
This was one of my favorite labs because me and my partner got to use if statements in order to get information for a fun number guessing game. We had to figure out how to use the proper return values and make sure that our calculations were correct on if the number was too high or too low. Then, once those if-statements were passed, we were able to see if the guess the user enters is a correct match to our secret number. 

Lab 6, part 2 
This was a fun lab to do because we got to incorporate the rules of the game of blackjack into our code. In this lab me and my partner also had to use command line arguments and sizes in order to pull the correct information. We also got the opportunity to use negation when we were writing our if statements to ensure the correct card values were being entered. In the end, we were able to print out a total score from our card values. 

Lab 8, part 1 
This was an interesting lab because my partner and I were able to use command line sizes and push back commands in order to get our information for the scores. Once we had this information, we were able to calculate the average and print it out to the user. This lab helped us get more comfortable with the push back ability and how to use the location of i to help us find information in our code.
